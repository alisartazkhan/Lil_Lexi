# LilLexi 
## Project Description
#### Lil Lexi allows a user to create a new document and to add text, images and simple geometric shapes to it. The user is able to make changes to the document. It should be possible to organize the text and images in rows and columns and to control the size and type of font. 
## Instructions to Run the Program:
#### Make sure the files are organized correctly as shown below:
* ![HIII](https://github.com/alisartazkhan/LilLexi/blob/main/DIR-org.png)
* Run `./src/LilLexi.java`
## Disclaimer
#### Program runs spellcheck using a Set of *1000* words so the display might show the word as a mispelling even though it might have the correct spelling. That's because that word isn't present in the 1000 word dictionary set that we provided.
